# React.js Calculator

This calculator was written to fulfill the reqirements of the freeCodeCamp [JavaScript Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) coding challenge.

The design and interface was inspired by macOS + iOS + 808s and Heartbreak.

The calculator uses Formula/Expression Logic, i.e. it follows the order of operations without requiring parenthesis.
